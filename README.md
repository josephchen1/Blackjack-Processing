# Blackjack
Simply the traditional, iconic casino game ‘Blackjack,’ but on Processing. 

# Motivation
Just a project for CSC506: Network & Mobile Architecture to warm-up and review Java.

# Getting Started
You would need Processing 3.5.3 or higher, although older versions should usually work.

1. Start your computer
2. Go to https://processing.org/download/ and download the most optimal version of the software 
3. Once downloaded, create a new project on Processing and download the zip file from the Github repository 
4. Drag all the files from the zip file into the new project folder, or into the Processing screen itself 
5. Run the project and enjoy
